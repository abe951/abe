This program's intended purpose is to serve as a calculator that performs addition and multiplication on any two positive integers using data structures and basic C++ tasks. Specifically, my code implementation primarily uses stacks to add and mutliply large numbers.

PREREQUISITES AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
It is important to understand the concepts of data structures and algorithms, specifically stacks, prior to using this code implementation

STEPS:
First, download and unzip the bignum-calculator-C++.zip file into your OS drive. Alternatively, you can run and compile the code in a cloud-based IDE such as CS50 IDE where you 

Then, install and use an IDE for C++ to run and compile the code such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Alternatively, you can run and compile the code in a cloud-based IDE such as CS50 IDE where you can directly upload the contents of the file and won't have to install any software locally.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The input file is where you can have any combination of add and multiply in any order but each operation must be separated by a new line and the operator word and operand integers must be separated by a space - for example...

add 1 1
multiply 1 1
add 5 3
add 3 5
multiply 2 4
multiply 4 2

The output of a working program given an input file containing the text above would look like:

1 + 1 = 2
1 * 1 = 1
5 + 3 = 8
3 + 5 = 8
2 * 4 = 8
4 * 2 = 8

The formatting of the output file allows you to easily visually check for errors in your math

By default, there is already an input and output file included in the contents of the .zip file with various combinations of add and multiply operations included
