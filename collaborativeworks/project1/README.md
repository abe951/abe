Essentially, this public project was a collaborative work developed by two aspiring software developers, Abraham Chango and Vahe Ovsepian. We used HTML and CSS to develop two basic-designed websites from scratch that explore the top 5 PS5 games that we suggest a new buyer should play and consider purchasing, where we also included the launch trailers of each game on the sequent webpage. Each webpage includes a link to the other webpage.
